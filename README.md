# Schoolbox-Clock
Enhance your Schoolbox experience with a detailed clock that features many features that Schoolbox is lacking.

The current extension for my schools schoolbox page is lacking features and usablitiy. My extension is based off a privous extension lacking feautes, updates and using old, deprecated systems. My verison works to overcome these flaws and expand on them while adding some highly wanted features.

Unlike the extension that I've based this off, mine doesn't access a pre-made google calander api for currenty periods and classes. My extension searches the webpage for your current period and classes to provide an outcome that is more widely suited for all. The extension also works for teachers alike and any schoolbox based website.

More updates to come and currently only works with a couple of schoolbox based websites due to limitations. I've licensed this under the MIT licensing, allowing others to contribute and apply their inputs to create a better product. Thanks for looking and let me know if you have any issues.
